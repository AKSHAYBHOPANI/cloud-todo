With Cloud To-Do you can remember things you want to achieve and improve your productivity. It is a React JS based full stack application using Firestore and OAuth on Google Cloud Platform.

### Steps

1.  Create a new Project on [Google Cloud](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate)
2.  Replace **cliendId** in /index.js which you can get from [OAuth Cloud Console API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent)
3.  Replace **_firebaseConfig_** in src/firebase.js with your config which you can get from creating a new project (When typing Project Name, your existing Google Cloud Project will auto appear. Use that to manage things in one place) in [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
4.             npm install
5.             npm start
